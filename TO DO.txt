URGENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

scheduled has wrong health insurance data
modify expense summary calculations to include all incomes except salary
	- implement code in an if statement so that I can turn this off if need be
	- potentially may like to make the on/off boolean a MYOD setting


SOON
---------------------------------------------------------------------


implement scheduled payments
	do a view/edit/delete scheduled payments gui
	add internet payments
finish implementation of trans_hist
	implement filters
implement GUIs for recording and displaying description of loans
	and then put $1100 against John. 15/10/12. Ubank - Others.
	John, Tom owe another $70 for xbox, ING Direct
		- John returned $300 29/10/12 Cash
		                $200 5/9/12
				$200 12/11/12
		- John returned $470 31/12/12
Look into add_data's reverse_sort.
	Is there any point to it?
	Does trans_hist violate the order assumption once a item is deleted
	Does reschedule violate the order assumption
Implement save_data and change all instances of existing codes use of save
Add optional end dates to scheduled payments
		

LATER
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Improve get_ functions significantly to make MYOD's base more flexible and reliable
 - consider making categories data that is loaded instead of hardcoded.
 - implemented as a numeric lookup table
 - make functions for adding categories (coded numbers should be automatically assigned)
 - can make function for removing a category (number is no longer used, string kept in history, but not returned in struct)
 - can make function for replacing category (new string is assigned to existing code) 
 - make wrapper GUIs for these extended functions. Allowing a user to control categories.
For the category GUI, must be a facility of highlighting some special meaning to different 
	categories. These categories in the list should appear a different colour. For 
	example, if certain categories should be accompanied by a note (such as loans)
Do a "where's my money going" gui
Make a scheduled payments gui - to view and delete scheduled payments
R2012a MATLAB help warns behaviour of ismember will change look into effect for me
make save_data general for all computers including the optional use of automating git.
add button to trans_hist to export listing in readable format to an excel spreadsheet.
make sure MYOD won't crash if computer doesn't have git installed

ONE DAY
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement reminders in MYOD, e.g., every month a pop-up until you 
	acknowledge it to check the balance of your phone bill
Reorder 'list's' so that 'others' always appears last in add_data
Add little pop up calendars for date selections
consider pretty pictures for the guis
lay out gui elements with spacing according to my rules
Smart Salary should be a fund. When using it, expenses are recorded in
	another matrix (no income needed).
Clock labour
make GUIs resizable
try to make rows in trans_hist light up when scrolled over
reorder 'lists' such that 'Others' always are displayed last
	but ensure index won't be affected
have prev and next pages for trans_hist?
when MYOD closes; all sub-guis should close
look into possibility of converting my MYOD program into an executable - RT package
look into option of bypassing GUIDE and programming GUI from scratch in MATLAB
code load_id so that even if user were to delete internals.mat, it will still work
MYOD should be able to work even if all of MYOD_data folder deleted
add settings button to MYOD - affects internals.mat variables
		            - option to upload data to a git account
			    - provide details like git address
		            - location to put MYOD data
